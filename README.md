# Order Management System (SOLID)

## Course
Design Patterns and Application Architecture  
Module 04 – SOLID Principles

## Description
This project demonstrates an order management system for an online store
implemented using SOLID principles.

## Implemented principles
- SRP – each class has a single responsibility
- OCP – new payment, delivery or discount types can be added without modifying existing code
- LSP – all implementations correctly replace base interfaces
- ISP – small and focused interfaces
- DIP – high-level modules depend on abstractions

## How to run
```bash
python src/main.py
